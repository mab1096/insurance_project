## Insurance Project - MLR/Prediction - Predictive Modeling

The Healthcare project was another final project for my Predictive Modeling class, where I utilized R, Excel, and Tableau to make log transforms so data fit a normal distribution because the data would work in this format without overfitting or confounding the data and then using healthcare insurance data to conduct Logistic Regression and utilizing a test and training model to predict insurance outcomes and rates based on the given healthcare data.
